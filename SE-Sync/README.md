# SE-Sync

**SE-Sync** is a *certifiably correct* algorithm for performing *synchronization over the special Euclidean group*: estimate the values of a set of unknown *poses* (positions and orientations in Euclidean space) given noisy measurements of a subset of their pairwise relative transforms.  This problem frequently arises in the context of 2D and 3D geometric estimation; for example, the foundational problems of [pose-graph SLAM](http://domino.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ws11/robotics2/pdfs/ls-slam-tutorial.pdf) (in robotics), [camera motion estimation](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/ftp/articles/pajdla/Martinec-Pajdla-CVPR-2007.pdf) (in computer vision), and [sensor network localization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3741000/) (in distributed sensing) all require synchronization over the special Euclidean group.  SE-Sync improves upon prior methods by exploiting a novel (convex) *semidefinite relaxation* of the special Euclidean synchronization problem to directly search for *globally* optimal solutions, and is capable of producing a *computational certificate of correctness* (global optimality) in the (typical) case that a global minimizer is found.

A detailed description of the algorithm and its implementation can be found in [technical report](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync/blob/master/SE-Sync%20-%20A%20Certifiably%20Correct%20Algorithm%20for%20Synchronization%20over%20the%20Special%20Euclidean%20Group.pdf).

## Installation
Before compiling SE-Sync, you should modify a place in example/main.cpp.

You should change the file name to the path of SEâ€”Sync optimized pose file on your computer, which is the same path as SE-Sync executable
```
string filename = "/home/xi/SE-Sync/C++/build/bin/poses_traj.txt";
```

Then you can build the project in SE-Sync directory with the following command.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
````
